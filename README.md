# What’s For Dinner?

## Abstract:
[//]: <>
This project represents a site that allows users to peruse a list of 50 delicious recipes, as well as search through the larger list to find recipes based off of tags or for specific recipe names.


## Installation Instructions:
[//]: <>
1. You will need two distinct directories - one for the front end and one to emulate the back end / server:

1. Clone down the frontend repo found at: https://github.com/bea-ordonez/WhatsCookin
Clone down the backend repo found at: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/whats-cookin-api

1. Install dependencies by using ‘npm install’ in your terminal within each directory. It is helpful in your terminal to create a second tab (with command + t on macs) in which to run the backend server.

1. To start backend server, within its directory run 'npm start'.

1. To host the front-end website on your local machine, run ’npm start’ in terminal.

1. Navigate to ‘http://localhost:8080/' in your browser.

## Testing Instructions:
[//]: <>

To run the test suite associated with the classes behind the scenes and how they interact: 
Run 'npm test' from the terminal while within the main directory of the application (Whats Cookin).

If you encounter errors when trying to host the site with webpack: Remember to use ‘npm install’ before trying to host the server on your local machine!
